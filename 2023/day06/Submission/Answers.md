## Write an article about File Permissions.

**`chmod`**:
- To change the permission of a file or directory, we can used the chmod (change mode).To use chmod to alter permission, we need to tell.

- For example. we have `file.txt` with some permission.

| owner | group | word |
| ---   | ---   | ---  |
| rw-   | r--   | r--  |

so , now we will change the permission of file.

**command**: `chmod 777 file.txt`
| owner | group | word |
| ---   | ---   | ---  |
| rwx   | rwx   | rwx  |
