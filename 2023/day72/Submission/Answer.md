![grafana-dashboard-english](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/6ffd3201-1e79-45b3-8eb1-fc777f7bac78)

1. **Metrics** 📊:

- **Metrics in Grafana** are the 📈 `data points` or measurements collected from various sources. These sources can include `servers`,` applications`, `devices`, or any system or service you want to monitor. Metrics are typically numerical and represent various aspects of the system's behavior, such as **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, **response times**, or any other **quantifiable data**.

- Grafana can collect metrics from different data sources, like **databases**, **time-series databases (e.g., Prometheus)**, **log files**, **APIs**, and more. It aggregates and stores these metrics for `analysis` and` visualization.`

2. **Visualizations** 📈:

- **Visualizations in Grafana** are the 📊 graphical representations of the metrics. Grafana offers a wide range of visualization options, including **charts**, **graphs**, and **tables**, to help you make sense of the **metrics data**. Some common visualizations include:

  - 1.  **Time Series Graphs** 📈: Line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots are used to represent time series data, showing how metrics change over time.

  - 2.  **Gauges** ⏩: Gauges are used to represent single values, such as the current value of a metric, often used for displaying the current state of a system.

  - 3.  **Heatmaps** 🔥: Heatmaps help visualize patterns or correlations in data using color-coding.

  - 4.  **Tables** 📋: Tabular data is presented in tables, allowing for easy inspection of specific values.

  - 5.  **Single Stats** 📈: Single statistics are single-number representations of a metric, useful for displaying key performance indicators.

  - 6.  **Alert Lists** 🚨: Alert lists show triggered alerts, indicating when specific conditions are met.
