1.What is **DevOps** ?

- **`DevOps`** is a set of practices that help `software developers` and `IT operations` teams work together to make the process of creating and delivering software `faster`, more `efficient`, and more `reliable`. 
- It involves using tools and `automation `to streamline the entire process, from writing code to `deploying` and `monitoring` it. 
- The goal is to make it easier and faster to create and update software, so that organizations can respond to customer needs more quickly and effectively.


2.What is **Automation**, **Scaling**, **Infrastructure** ?

**`Automation`**: 
- Automation refers to the process of using tools and software to automate manual and repetitive tasks.
- This can include anything from running automated tests on software to automatically deploying code to servers.
Eg. We use python automation for excel sheet.

**`Scaling`**: 
- Scaling refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to a system in order to accommodate changes in demand. 
- This can include adding more servers to handle increased traffic, or reducing the number of servers during periods of low activity.
Eg. We use Kubernetes for Scaling any application.

**`Infrastructure`**:
- Infrastructure refers to the physical and virtual components that make up a system or network, including servers,
databases, networks, and software.
- Examples of infrastructure in the context of IT include servers, databases, networking equipment, storage devices,
operating systems, virtual machines, and cloud computing platforms.


3.Why **DevOps is Important** ?

- DevOps is important because it helps organizations to deliver `software faster`, `more efficiently`, and with `higher quality`.
- DevOps enables organizations to `work more collaboratively`, and to automate many of the processes involved in software delivery.
- DevOps also promotes a `culture of continuous improvement`, where teams are constantly seeking to identify and `eliminate inefficiencies` in the software delivery process.
