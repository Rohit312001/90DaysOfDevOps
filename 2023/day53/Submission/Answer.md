# Day 53: Your CI/CD pipeline on AWS - Part 4 ðŸš€

## What is CodePipeline ?

- CodePipeline **builds**, **tests**, and **deploys** your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define.Think of it as a `CI/CD Pipeline` service.

## Workflow of CodePipeline

- A **pipeline** defines your release process `workflow`, and describes how a new code change progresses through your release process. A pipeline comprises a series of stages (e.g., `build`, `test`, and `deploy`), which act as logical divisions in your workflow. Each stage is made up of a `sequence of actions`, which are tasks such as building code or deploying to test environments.
- `AWS CodePipeline` provides you with a `graphical user interface` to **create**, **configure**, and **manage your pipeline** and its various stages and actions, allowing you to easily visualize and model your release `process workflow`.

### Previously on Day 50, 51 & 52 we have done the following:

- _Created a CodeCommit Repository._
- _Created a CodeBuild Project._
- _Created a CodeDeploy Application_.

### Today we will make a CodePipeline that will get the code from CodeCommit, Builds the code using CodeBuild and deploys it to a Deployment Group.

## Task-01 :

- **`Step-01`**: Go to `CodePipeline` service from `AWS Management Console`.

- **`Step-02`**: Click on `Create pipeline`.

- **`Step-04`**: Select `AWS CodeCommit` as `Source provider` and select your `Repository name` and `Branch name` and click on `Next`.

- **`Step-06`**: Select `AWS CodeDeploy` as `Deploy provider` and select your `Region` and `Application name` and `Deployment group` and click on `Next`.

- **`Step-07`**: Review your pipeline.

- Click on `Create pipeline`.

- Thus, your `pipeline is created`.

- Thus now go to the Public IP of your `EC2 Instance` and check the running `index.html` file.

So we have successfully created a `CI/CD Pipeline` on `AWS` using `CodeCommit`, `CodeBuild` & `CodeDeploy`.
