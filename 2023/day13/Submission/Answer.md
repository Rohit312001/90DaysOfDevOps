# **What is Python?**

- Python is a Open source, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
- It was created by **Guido van Rossum**
- Python consists of vast libraries and various frameworks like Django,Tensorflow, Flask, Pandas, Keras etc.

# Tasks 

## Install Python in your respective OS, and check the version.
**`Step 1:`**

## Different Data Types in Python.

![Python-Data-Types-Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76991475/226727105-8c8cede0-3f59-4794-8ccf-5a72f554169e.png)


**`String:`**
- A `String` is a collection of one or more characters put in a **single quote**,**double quote** or **triple quote**.
```
# DataType Output: str
x = "Hello World"
```
**`Integer:`**
- It contains **positive** and **negative** whole numbers(without `fractions` or `decimals`).
```
# DataType Output: int
x = 50
```
**`float:`**
- It is a real number with a **floating-point** representation.It is specified by the `decimal` points.

```
# DataType Output: float
x = 60.5
```
**`Complex Number:`**
- It is specified as `(real part)` + `(imaginary part)`.
```
# DataType Output: complex
x = 3j+2
```
**`list:`**
- **Lists** is just like an arrays,declared in other language which is an `ordered collection of data`.
```
# DataType Output: list
x = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]
```
**`Tuples:`**
- Just like a **list**,a tuple is also an `ordered collection of Python objects`.The only **difference** between a **tuple** and **list** is that tuples are `immutable` i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created.
```
# DataType Output: tuple
x = ("geeks", "for", "geeks")
```
**`Dictionary:`**
- A `dictionary` in Python is an unordered collection of `data values`, used to store data values like a map, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a Dictionary holds a **key: value pair**. 
- Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more **optimized**. 
```
# DataType Output: dict
x = {"name": "Suraj", "age": 24}
```
**`Set:`**
- A **Set** is an unordered collection of data types that is `iterable`, `mutable` and has no duplicate elements.
```
# DataType Output: set
x = {"geeks", "for", "geeks"}
```
**`Boolean:`**
- Data type with one of the two built-in values,`True` or `False`.
```
# DataType Output: bool
x = True
```
