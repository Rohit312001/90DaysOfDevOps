## What is Amazon CloudWatch?

- **Amazon CloudWatch** is a `monitoring` and `management service` that provides **data** and **actionable insights for AWS**, **on-premises, hybrid**, and other **cloud applications** and **infrastructure resources**. You can `collect` and `access` all your performance and operational data in the form of **`logs`** and **`metrics`** from a single platform rather than monitoring them in silos `(server, network, or database).` You can use **CloudWatch to set high resolution alarms**, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to optimize your applications, and ensure they are running smoothly.
- CloudWatch enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, network, and services) and `use alarms`, `logs`, and `events data` to take `automated actions` and `reduce mean time` to `resolution (MTTR)`. This frees up important resources and allows you to focus on building applications and business value.

## What is Amazon SNS?

- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** is a managed service that provides `message delivery` from **publishers** to **subscribers** (also known as producers and consumers). `Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers` by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as `Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose`, `Amazon SQS`, `AWS Lambda`, `HTTP`, `email`, `mobile push notifications`, and `mobile text messages (SMS)`.

**Some of the feature of AWS SNS are:**

- **Application-to-application messaging:** `Application-to-application` messaging supports subscribers such as `Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose` `delivery streams`, `Lambda functions`, `Amazon SQS queues`, `HTTP/S endpoints`, and `AWS Event Fork Pipelines`.

- **Application-to-person notifications:** `Application-to-person` notifications provide user notifications to subscribers such as `mobile applications`, `mobile phone numbers`, and `email addresses`.

- **Message durability:** `Published messages are stored across multiple`, geographically `separated servers` and `data centers`.If a subscribed endpoint isn't available, Amazon SNS runs a delivery retry policy.To preserve any messages that aren't delivered before the delivery retry policy ends, you can create a dead-letter queue.
