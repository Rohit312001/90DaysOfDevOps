# Day 18 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

### Till now you have created Docker file and pushed it to the Repository. Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker concepts.

## What is Docker Compose ?

- **Docker Compose** is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. 
- It is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, using a **`YAML`** file to configure the application's ***`services`**, **`networks`**, and **`volumes`**.
- With Docker Compose, you can easily configure and run multiple containers as a single application, making it easier to manage and deploy complex applications.
- Docker Compose is often used for **developing** and **testing applications locally**, as it allows you to define and `run an entire application stack on a single machine`. 
- It also makes it easy to share your `application's configuration` with other developers, as the configuration is stored in a `single YAML file`that can be committed to version control.

## What is YAML?

- YAML is a **`data serialization`** language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, **`YAML`** stands for **`Yet Another Markup Language or YAML`** ainâ€™t markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents. 
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is `human-readable`and easy to understand.
- YAML files use a **`.yml`** or **`.yaml`** extension.

### Steps to create Docker-Compose.yaml file :

**`Step1:`** Version (Version of Docker Compose).

**`Step2:`** Services (Where we add containers)

Eg.(**`Containers`**,**`images`**,**`port`**,**`environments`**)

**`Step3:`** We can create multiple environment like this.

## Task-1:

### Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Task-2:

### Pull a pre-existing **Docker image from a public repository** (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine.

### Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.

---
### Use the docker logs command to view the container's log output.

`docker log <container_id>`

---
### Use the docker stop and docker start commands to stop and start the container.

**`To stop the docker container`**
`docker stop <container_id>or<image_id>`

### Use the docker rm command to remove the container when you're done.
`docker rm <container_id>or<image_id>`
