# Day 75: Grafana Loki Handson Tutorial

### ðŸ“Š What is Grafana, and why is it used for monitoring?

- **Grafana** is an ðŸ“ˆ `open-source` **analytics and monitoring** platform that allows users to `visualize`, `query`, and `analyze data` from various data sources. It's commonly used for monitoring because it provides a user-friendly interface for creating `interactive dashboards` and `alerts`, making it easier to track the performance of systems and applications.

### Why Grafana?

- **Grafana** is the top choice for monitoring and data visualization, and here's why: it's `open-source` and packed with powerful features.
- It **seamlessly connects to different data sources** and provides user-friendly dashboards for making data easy to understand.
- Grafana is particularly great with data that changes over time, making it ideal for tracking evolving **metrics**.
- It also has strong alerting capabilities to `catch issues` early and a **robust plugin system** that lets you customize and integrate with various tools.
- With Grafana, exploring **historical data** is a breeze, allowing for `deep analysis`. It's a versatile tool that encourages teamwork and can be tailored to your specific needs, making it perfect for teams and organizations looking for **effective monitoring** and **observability solutions.**

### Grafana Installation

- For detailed installation steps, please visit my Day 73 Blog for complete steps on how to install Grafana on AWS EC2.

- **Blog Link :** [Grafana Installation on AWS EC2 Instance](https://devops-rohit.hashnode.dev/day-73-grafana-on-aws-ec2-setup-tutorial)

- As we have already installed Grafana on AWS EC2, we will now move on to the next step.

### What is Grafana Loki?

- **Grafana Loki** is a `horizontally -scalable`,`highly-available`, multi-tenant **log aggregration** system inspired by **Prometheus.** It is designed to be `very cost effective` and `easy to operate`.
- Loki is bult around the idea of only indexing `labels for logs` and leaving the `originals logs messages unindexed`. This means that loki is cheaper to operate and can be order of magnitude more efficient.
- The loki project was started at Grafana labs in 2018. Loki is released under the `AGPLv3 license`.

### How does Grafana Loki Works?

![logs-loki-diagram](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/58d75238-617f-44c3-a075-607b411e1012)

- **Pull in any logs with Promtail:** Promtail is a `logs collector` built specifically for Loki. It uses the same service discovery as Prometheus and includes analogous features for labeling, transforming, and filtering logs before ingestion into Loki.

- **Store the logs in Loki:** Loki does not index the `text of logs`. Instead, entries are grouped into **streams and indexed** with labels.Not only does this `reduce costs`, it also means log lines are available to query within milliseconds of being received by `Loki`.

- **Use LogQL to explore:** Use Lokiâ€™s powerful query language, **LogQL**, to explore your `logs`. Run LogQL queries directly within Grafana to visualize your logs alongside other data sources, or with LogCLI, for those who prefer a command line experience.

- **Alert on your logs:** Set up `alerting rules` for `Loki to evaluate` on your incoming log data. Configure Loki to send the resulting alerts to a Prometheus Alertmanager so they can then get routed to the right team.

### What is Promtail?

- **Promtail** is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private `Grafana Loki instance or Grafana Cloud`. It is usually deployed to every machine that runs applications which need to be monitored.

1. **It primarily:**

- Discovers targets
- Attaches labels to log streams
- Pushes them to the Loki instance.
