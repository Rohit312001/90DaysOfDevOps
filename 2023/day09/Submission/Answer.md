# Day 9 Task: Deep Dive in Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.

## What is Git and why is it important?
- `Git` is a **version control** system used to manage `source code` and `track changes` made to it. It allows **multiple developers** to `collaborate on a project by keeping a history of changes to the code` and allowing them to work on different versions of the code in parallel.
- It provides features such as **distributed architecture**, **branching**, and **merging**, which make it easier to `manage code development` and `collaborate effectively`.
- Overall, Git is important because it enables efficient and effective software development by providing a centralized repository of code, version control, and collaboration tools.


## What is difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch?
- The difference between "main" and "master" branches is purely a matter of naming convention. Functionally, they work the same way and can be used interchangeably.
- Both branches represent the main line of development in the repository and are used to track the latest stable version of the code.


## Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?
- **`Git`** is a `version control` system that allows you to `manage` and `track changes` to your `source code`. It is a **software tool** that you `install` on your `local computer` and use to manage your `code repositories`.
- **`GitHub`** is a **web-based** platform that provides a centralized location for `hosting Git repositories`. It is a `web-based service` that allows you to `host your Git repositories` and `collaborate with others on your code`.


## How do you create a new repository on GitHub?
**step 1:**

**step 2:**

Now hit enter to **`Create Repository`**.Thus how we created our repository on Github.


## What is difference between local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?
- A `local repository` is a copy of a codebase that is stored on your local machine.It includes all the files, directories, and version control information related to a particular project. 

- In contrast, a `remote repository` is a version of the same codebase that is stored on a remote server, typically in the cloud.
