# Day 58: Ansible Playbooks

- **Ansible playbooks** run `multiple tasks`, `assign roles`, and `define configurations`, `deployment steps`, and `variables`. If youâ€™re using **multiple servers**, Ansible playbooks organize the steps between the `assembled machines` or `servers` and get them organized and running in the way the users need them to. Consider playbooks as the equivalent of instruction manuals.

- It allows you to describe the desired state of your `systems` and `applications` in a **declarative manner**, and Ansible takes care of executing the `necessary tasks` to achieve that state.

- Ansible playbooks are written in **YAML**. YAML is a `human-readable data serialization language`. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being `stored` or `transmitted`.

- **YAML** stands for **YAML Ain't Markup Language**. It is a human-readable data serialization language and commonly used for configuration files, but it can be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

## Task-02

### **Ansible playbooks:**

- An **Ansible playbook** is a `structured` and `human-readable document` written in **YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) that defines a `set of tasks` and configurations to be performed on remote servers. **Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation** and allow you to define the desired state of your systems and applications.

- **YAML Syntax:** `Playbooks` are written in YAML format, which is a `human-readable markup language`. YAML uses indentation and colons to structure `data hierarchically`. Indentation is crucial in YAML to define the `nesting levels of data`.

- **Play:** A `playbook` starts with a `list of plays`. Each play targets a **specific group of hosts** and defines a **set of tasks** to be executed on those **hosts**.

- **name:** A user-friendly name for the play.

- **hosts:** The group(s) of hosts this play will target. Host groups are defined in the inventory file.

- **become:** Indicates whether privilege escalation is required to perform tasks (using sudo).

- **tasks:** List of tasks to be executed in this play.

For Example;

```
---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    # Tasks will be defined here
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
```

- **name:** A description of the task.

- **module:** The Ansible module to use for the task (e.g., apt, yum, file, copy, etc.).

- **module_arguments:** Arguments specific to the module being used.
